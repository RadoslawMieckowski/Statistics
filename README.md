# Statistics
this repository is about lotto statistics, which were made for fun. It's very big and intricate 
Notice: there's a lot of bad code in this repository (in many aspects), but someone can find a tools in:
### Statistics/src/main/java/miniLotto/utilities/ 
directory usseful. 
It comprises: 
* Extractors
* Filters
* Finders
* Lists and Maps factories
* Lists and Maps presenters
* Serializer
* List Parsers
* advanced statistics
* and many more :)

Every util in this directory was tested and should work as expected
